I am looking for motivated PhD students to join my research group at The University of Memphis. Our group focuses on advancing fundamental and applied research in machine learning, with particular interest in Active Learning, Uncertainty Quantification, and AI for Science. Students will have the opportunity to work on cutting-edge research problems, publish in top-tier venues (NeurIPS, ICML, AAAI, etc.), and collaborate across disciplines.

Spring and Fall 2026
======
There are multiple positions open in **Spring and Fall 2026**. Students with deep learning skills and a strong foundation in programming/mathematics are encouraged to reach out. Students with research experience in machine learning, data mining, or computational physics are preferred.
