Spring and Fall 2026
======
I am looking for motivated PhD students to join my research group at The University of Memphis. Our group focuses on advancing fundamental and applied research in machine learning, with particular interest in Active Learning, Uncertainty Quantification, and AI for Science. Students will have the opportunity to work on cutting-edge research problems, publish in top-tier venues (NeurIPS, ICML, AAAI, etc.), and collaborate across disciplines.
